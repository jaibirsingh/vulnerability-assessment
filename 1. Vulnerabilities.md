# Goals of the module
1. Describe vulnerabilities
2. Recognise Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures reports + National Vulnerability Database submissions
3. Understand non-technical vulnerabilities (Layer A vulnerabilities)
4. Describe vulnerability management
5. Perform network auditing
6. Perform vulnerability research

**NIST definition**
* A weakness in the computational logic (e.g. code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity or availability.

**Vulnerabilities generally come from:**
* Softwares
* Operating system

**Who find vulnerabilities**
* DevSecOps engineers
* Security researchers
* Pentesters
* Software developers
* Users, on accident

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
* Funded by U.S department of Homewland SEcurity

**NVD (National Vulnerabilities Database)**
* MAintained by NIST

**CVE Identifiers**

**Understanding Vulnerability Detail Pages**
* Descriptions
* Severity --> tools used for this purpose
* References
* Weakness Enumeration
* Known affected software configurations
